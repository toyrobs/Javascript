
lastIndexOf()

Without using the native “Array.prototype.lastIndexOf” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “myUnshift” (typo) that will take in an array of elements and returns the index of the last encounter of a target element (if it is found) or -1 if that element does not exist within the input array.
